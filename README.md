Ricky Lin / Zhang Zhang 
1.	Logistic regression (20% Testing , 80% Training) _ TF-IDF 
Accuracy: 99%

Training of models 
1.	Bag of World: 93% -> Multinomial
2.	TF-IDF: 97% -> Multinomial

Next Phase: 

K fold cross validation for finding optimal hyperparameter
Testing with uvic dataset (see how much email they can catch)


Questions:
Can we add some more feature (number of email, link,) beside the number of word (bag of word, TF IDF)
